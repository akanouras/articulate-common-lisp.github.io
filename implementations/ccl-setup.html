<h1 class="title">Clozure CL Setup</h1>
</header>
<p>Clozure is an open source Lisp system provided by Clozure associates.</p>
<h2 id="installing">Installing</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ll defer to their instructions for <a href="http://ccl.clozure.com/download.html">installation</a>.</p>
<p>Of particular interest is that it works on the PPC and ARM architectures; this can be of use to embedded system developers. It is possible to get <a href="http://mickcharlesbeaver.blogspot.com/2014/01/clozure-common-lisp-ccl-on-raspberry-pi.html">CCL working on the Raspberry Pi</a>, for instance.</p>
<p>CCL is particularly well-developed on Mac OS X, including a Cocoa bridge and an IDE. It&#8217;s also a good choice on Windows as it supports native (Win32) threads.</p>
<p>In general, like SBCL, it&#8217;s designed to be used as the backend to an IDE.</p>
<p>Note that each platform has a <em>different</em> CCL executable.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Linux: lx86cl, lx86cl64</p></li>
<li><p>OSX: dx86cl, dx86cl64</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: wx86cl.exe, wx86cl64.exe</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="linedit">Linedit</h2>
<p>A CLI tool called linedit is useful.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp">(ql:quickload :linedit)
(require :linedit)
(funcall (intern &quot;INSTALL-REPL&quot; :linedit) :wrap-current t)</code></pre>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>CCL, in general, is very fast to load and has a good reputation for performance.</p>
